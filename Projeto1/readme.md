# Implementation - Decision Tree, ID3, Parallel.

# Data-set's objective:

Predict the grade of a student based on:  
- Categorical demographic data.  
- Categorical academic participation data.  
- Categorical social factors data.  
- Categorical lifestyle and style data.  

## Data-set:

1. Data-set Link:
*[Original Data-set - Atif Masih](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atifmasih/factors-affecting-university-student-grades)  
2. Folders:
- `StudentData.csv`				-> Original data-set  
- `PrepData/*.csv`				-> Pre-processed data-set files  
- `PrepData/Stdnt_Oversampled_Train/Test.txt`	-> Oversampled data read by the *.cpp files  
3. Data Preprocessing and Oversampling:  
- Read the `Data-set/readme.md` to populate the folders. These were deleted to save storage.

# Rodando o programas:

The oversampled data was converted into text files: `Stdnt_Oversampled_<Test||Train>.txt`.
